      "disease_name": "Bipolar Disorder",
      "disease_detail": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood swings can affect sleep, energy levels, judgment, behavior, and the ability to function effectively. Bipolar disorder is classified into several types, including bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder, and other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown but likely involves a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Treatment typically involves medication, psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, and support from healthcare providers and loved ones to manage symptoms, prevent relapses, and improve overall quality of life.",

    "Bladder cancer": {
      "disease_name": "Bladder Cancer",
      "disease_detail": "Bladder cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the bladder, the organ responsible for storing urine. It is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, with the majority of cases diagnosed in individuals over the age of 55. The most common type of bladder cancer is transitional cell carcinoma, which develops in the cells lining the inside of the bladder. Other types include squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Risk factors for bladder cancer include smoking, exposure to certain chemicals or toxins, chronic bladder inflammation, age, gender, and genetic factors. Symptoms may include blood in the urine, frequent urination, pain during urination, and pelvic or back pain. Treatment options depend on the stage and grade of the cancer and may include surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these approaches.",
      "cause": [
        "Tobacco use: Cigarette smoking is the most significant risk factor for bladder cancer, with smokers being several times more likely to develop the disease than non-smokers. Chemicals in tobacco smoke are absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted in urine, directly exposing the bladder lining to carcinogens.",
        "Occupational exposures: Occupational exposure to certain chemicals, dyes, solvents, or industrial toxins such as aromatic amines (e.g., benzidine, 2-naphthylamine), aniline dyes, aromatic hydrocarbons, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may increase the risk of bladder cancer.",

Common causes of BOO include benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture, pelvic organ prolapse, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, or bladder outlet dysfunction. Symptoms of BOO may include urinary hesitancy, weak urinary stream, intermittency, dribbling, incomplete bladder emptying, urinary retention, or overflow incontinence. Diagnosis typically involves urodynamic testing, cystoscopy, imaging studies, or urinary flow studies.

Wound botulism occurs when the bacteria infect a wound and produce toxins, resulting in similar symptoms. Infant botulism occurs when infants ingest spores of the bacteria, which then colonize the intestines and produce toxins, leading to symptoms such as constipation, poor feeding, and weakness. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, history of exposure, and laboratory testing of specimens.

The MEFV gene provides instructions for making a protein called pyrin (also known as marenostrin), which is found in white blood cells. This protein is involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this process is complete, the body stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.",
